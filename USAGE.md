   Product folder: /Users/nelsonchan/Downloads/black-tailored-pants
   Competitor: https://motelrocks.com/products/tova-tie-trouser

## Example Commands

### New Deployment
```
"Deploy landing page for Blue Denim Jacket

Product folder: /Users/nelsonchan/Downloads/denim-jacket
Competitor: https://levis.com/denim-trucker-jacket
Pricing: order $89, preorder $29, bump $15"
```

### Fix Existing Site
```
"Fix the checkout in /Users/nelsonchan/Downloads/blackpants"
```

```
"Convert /Users/nelsonchan/Downloads/old-site to match rebuild template"
```

```
"Optimize images in /Users/nelsonchan/Downloads/slow-site for faster loading"
```

### If Missing Info
Skill will ask:
- "What's the competitor URL for pricing analysis?"
- "What material is the product?" (for care instructions)
- "Any specific features to highlight?"

## What You Get

✅ **Fully optimized landing page** (sub-1.8s load)
✅ **15-25 product-specific testimonials** (matches your avatar count)
✅ **Auto-chosen order bump** (matching accessory)
✅ **Product-specific colors** (extracted from your images)
✅ **WebP optimized images** (responsive sizes)
✅ **GitHub repo + Netlify deployment**
✅ **SimpleSwap crypto checkout** integrated

## File Naming (Doesn't Matter!)

Your images can be named anything:
```
IMG_1234.jpg  →  auto-renamed to product-01.png
photo.heic    →  auto-renamed to product-02.png
avatar1.png   →  auto-renamed to testimonial-01.png
```

The skill standardizes everything automatically.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: What if I don't have a competitor URL?**
A: Skill will prompt you for it, or you can say "no competitor" and it will use default pricing.

**Q: How many testimonial images do I need?**
A: 15-25 images. The skill will generate exactly as many testimonials as you provide images.

**Q: Can I change the influencers in "Worn by Favorites"?**
A: No - those are fixed (Alix Earle, Monet McMichael, Alex Cooper) and stay the same across all products.

**Q: What if my images are huge (10MB each)?**
A: No problem! The skill auto-optimizes to WebP with responsive sizes. 10MB becomes 60KB.

**Q: Can I fix an existing deployment?**
A: Yes! Just point the skill to the folder and ask it to fix specific issues or rebuild entirely.
